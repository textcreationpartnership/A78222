            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHere I meet with a Gentleman, or a Scholler, I dare be bold: and if I muſt Apologize, it ſhall be careleſly ſhort. Though I have bin in <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> Schoole, I gained not his Art. My pen never added to my Purſe. And if I ſeene to follow <hi>Zeno,</hi> 'twas over-galled inke forced mee to acerbate mine. That's all. My Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ends I doubt not, the enemy is in the field, and <hi>I</hi> am one in Front. But what he feared I ſaw not; hee's wheeled about, and fals foule on a Canon. How he can get off you ſhall ſee, and when he retreats, He charge him home.</p>
            <p>Whom there he fights againſt are double fortified, with the Text, and with the Church: the one commands, the other preſſeth the performance. I perceive no indifferencie, if the great Chalenger can ſhew any, I will be ſet at his will.</p>
            <p>A plaine injunction I finde by the Letter of the Text, an outward duty too, and both ſo in the ſence of the Church. Enough thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to make his diſobedience to God, and Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, inexcuſable,</p>
            <p>A ceremony, who can tell any thing, knowes it to be: but to be or not to be any thing, I know not who can tell. If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hold it principally by humane inſtitution, in their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they keepe the divine precept. Without this <hi>Thraſos</hi> liſts I heare of none that leave or take.</p>
            <p>Two ſorts he deſcribes, the firſt I am in, the ſecond he's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Upon whom he is, their ground is the Text and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: the Text to warrant, the Canon to bind.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ieſu-Maſtix</hi> cals that ridiculous. I ſay 'tis not. For
<pb facs="tcp:121081:4"/> if the Text doe but warrant, it cannot binde. If it warrant, the Canon is in force; becauſe the Church hath authority in, not againſt, nor beſide the Analogy of the truth.</p>
            <p>The truth then for its dignity, holding diverſe ſenſes, and none repugnant, the ſame may appeare a command to ſome, to others a warrant, and yet neither be wrong, though both reach not home.</p>
            <p>A command is more then a warrant, a warrant is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a command, and he that is not againſt, is with us: but if the Church ſee the Command, which every one doth not, her authority makes that a Command to them, to whom it ſeemed a bare warrant,</p>
            <p>There is no denying this, without denying the firſt precept of the ſecond Table, Yet ſhe is not above the Scripture, but ſeeth that a duty be not loſt, Where two wayes goe to the right, ſhe taketh care that we miſſe not both,</p>
            <p>The danger is, if ſhe ſhould inhibit what's a command to me, and a warrant to another, If ſhe doe, obeying Gods command, I will endure her mulct. Whom I cannot informe let him looke to himſelfe. As I will oppoſe contempt, <hi>I</hi> ſhall never juſtifie ignorance, nor negligence.</p>
            <p>His compariſon of the Canon and order, is a gin for a gull, a daring anticipation, and Fathers that on the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which was never begot in the Chriſtian World. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blindneſſe ſhall never make me graceleſſe to my mother.</p>
            <p>The Epiſtolers deſcant on the Canon, remembers thee of, and confutes the 14 ſcandalous lines in his dedication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Lord Ieſus ſhall be mentioned, due &amp; lowly reverence ſhall be done by all perſons,</hi> are the words of the Canon, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth: and I trow due and lowly reverence is neither ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, nor innovation: doth neither peſter the Church, nor grieve the well-affected: Is neither forbidden by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious order, nor upheld by pride and ſhame: Is no malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant principle, nor polluteth the peoples judgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>; is not
<pb facs="tcp:121081:4"/> more ſpecious then religious; no monſter of many heads; no point of popery; no producer of dangerous concluſions, nor contrary to the Text.</p>
            <p>Beware Reader! the mind is wicked, that runs at his riot. <hi>I</hi> had rather erre with the Church, then be ſingular againſt the truth: But erre I cannot, whilſt the Canon is made good in the Text, and not the Text inferiour by the Canon.</p>
            <p>What occaſioned him to publiſh his Treatiſe, if ambition did not? For the particulars he recounts viz. the Archbiſhops urging the Canon; Divines preaching damnation to the will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full refuſers, might have cauſed him to diſtruſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>To the reſt: That his Pariſhioners ſtaggered, think it was upon his owne doctrine. That he found empty ſtuffe in the upholders of our practiſe, impute to his falſe judgment. That it hath no foundation on the Text, attribute to his will. That he was ſtyled Factious and Schiſmaticall, hold it iuſtly, and his owne glory. That he received muddy teaſons of ſome, and rayling above meaſure, deeme the faireſt gloſſe on himſelfe. That we have no Scripture for our opinion, bid him bite his tongue for the report.</p>
            <p>Againſt whom he malitiouſly inveighs, if I minde the ſame Gentleman, he is a very religious, reverend, learned, diſcreet, temperate, and orthodox divine.</p>
            <p>If he accounted this Challengers arguments light, <hi>I</hi> tell thee, they are but froth. If he would not admit one of his Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the conference, twas his wiſdome becauſe the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is exceeding heady. If he denyed ſome other demands, I know his worth ſuch that he might not yeeld to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſparagement to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But that he appeared not in this practiſe before his Grace of <hi>Canterburies</hi> time, and that he ſtudied more houres in the queſtion, then others had done minutes, are ſo ſutable to <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Gyles</hi> Chipps, that <hi>I</hi> dare ſay they came from his owne block.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121081:5"/>
            <p>To ſatiſfie thee throughly, the worthy Theologue hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſuch obloquie from this maligne one that amends can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made him without ſome publike recantation. Yet I hope to beg his pardon: becauſe in the marginall notes of his Epiſtle he is more wilde then wily:</p>
            <p>At laſt hee's returned where he began. And now <hi>Buccae noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenda eſt menſura ſuae,</hi> the wide of his mouth ſhalbe knowne. His clawing at firſt, that my opinion is not ſo abſur'd, nor ſo groſſe, at the laſt, as the former, I will mind when my back wants rubbing.</p>
            <p>'Tis confeſſed that foure Syllogiſmes <hi>I</hi> received, and bee it knowne that the anſwer <hi>I</hi> promiſed he had. The ſumme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this. The Syllogiſmes were falſe in forme and matter, their proofes very weak, fallacious, inconſiſtent, and much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Arrianiſme. His note of no reaſon, and all rayling is expunged thus. If he can ſhew me any irrationall, or ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Line under my hand I will not onely pardon his ill tongue, but give it leave to raile at me ever.</p>
            <p>The reader by that which followes may iudge whether I gave a boaſt beyond the Victorie; whether great reproaches neceſſitated him to challenge the Field, cleare himſelfe, and try the Valour of our Kind; whether it bee poſſible for his Forces to helpe them that ſtagger and are miſſed, whether he prove that bowing at the Name of Ieſus hath no command, no not the leaſt warrant from Phil. 2.9.10.

                        <p>What's this to the Name? but here you doe, <hi>petere caelum Stultitia,</hi> even what you can to overthrow the gracious diſpenſation of God. As if the three equall might not chooſe one through, by, and in whom all would be reconciled, knowne, and honoured all. Is it againſt the Scripture that rhe Sonne was humbled, and not the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt? Why then ſhould the exaltation terminated in the perſon of the Son, and not of the Father, nor of the Holy Ghoſt be againſt the Scriptures? This advancing of <hi>Ieſus</hi> doth ſhew that our ſalvation conſulted by the three Perſons, and undertaken onely by the ſecond, is equally to the glory of all. The doctrine is frequent in the new Teſtament, and the more the more deſperate your oppoſition. 'Tis not the ſaying, that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted himſelfe when all things are ſubjected unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or that at 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.27. <hi>&amp;c. Jeſus</hi> is advanced over creatures onely, will exeme him from the high ſublimation, wherein the glory of the bleſſed Trinity is; and no where elſe refulgent. The Father not ſubjecting declares equality, and the Sons eminency

It may appeare from <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13. a place correſpondent in phraſe and ſenſe to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.10. where the Holy Ghoſt having ſpoken before of all rationall creatures, how they praiſed Chriſt, ſpeakes there of irrationall, both ſenſitive, and inſenſitive, and refers them to every creature, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in earth, and under the earth, and in the Sea, which creatures groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning now and travelling in paine for the ſin of man, do long for the day of redemption, at which time they ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, and now in their kind they praiſe and glorifie Chriſt in hope of it, but at that day ſhall their fulleſt praiſe and ſubjection be.

I reply. 1. I would faine know how it is, that they bow after their kind and manner, except it be by their obedience
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121081:15"/> and ſubjection, will they nill they to the dominion of the Lord Ieſus. 2.

Seeing then that the moſt of the creatures can fulfill the Text without bowing corporall knees; it is manifeſt that bowing corporall knees is not expreſſely required in the Text. Surely it would aruge want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in God, or great injuſtice, if he ſhould command his creatures that duty, which they cannot performe.

If it ſhould be ſaid that thoſe Subjects of ſuch a King cannot pay, where it is not, it is ſufficient that they pay what they are able; but let them that are able, pay the whole ſum. I anſwer, this had beene reaſonable, if the Kings command had beene ſo; but how ſhall this excuſe the King, that againſt his knowledge ſhall command all his Subjects to pay alike, as well thoſe that are not able, as thoſe that are? So to ſay in reſpect of this bowing, let thoſe that have no knees, pay what they can, but let thoſe that have knees pay knees; It were faire indeed, if God ſhould leave it ſo at liberty, But how can this acquit God of want of wiſedome and juſtice, if he ſhould command all creatures and things to bow corporall knees, when he knoweth that the moſt of his creatures, and things, have no ſuch knees to bow.</q>

                           <p>THe Bowers at the Name Ieſus, to make their opinion and practiſe good, doe thus underſtand <hi>in the Name of Ieſus</hi> to be at the mention of the Name Ieſus. But I infer, that this interpretation is ſenſleſſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, having for it no ground or warrant from Scripture. For 1. as I ſaid before, this phraſe, <hi>Name of Ieſus,</hi> is never taken for the Name Ieſus, or for any other Titles of our Saviour. 2. Therefore, <hi>In the Name of Ieſus,</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be taken for at the mention of the Name Ieſus any where. 3. This phraſe, <hi>In the Name,</hi> prefixed before any of the Titles of the Deity, as in the Name of Chriſt, Lord, God, &amp;c. is never taken for at the Naming of any of theſe Names in any part of the old and new Teſtament, but if any ſhall faſten ſuch a ſenſe upon it any where, it will marre and murder the ſenſe, as indeed it doth the ſenſe of this Text by that expoſition. To inſtance but in two places amongſt many. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.10. <hi>All Nations compaſſed me about, but in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them;</hi> would not it be a wilde ſenſe to ſay, At the Naming of the Lord <hi>I</hi> will deſtroy them? So <hi>Act.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Saul ſpake boldly in the Name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> were it not infinitely abſurd to ſay, that he ſpake boldly at the Naming of the Lord Ieſus? Thus ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:121081:17"/> will the ſenſe be made everywhere, where this phraſe is uſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this expoſition, try it who will.</p>
                           <p>This expoſition which they make of the Text is one of the maine pilars of their cauſe, which did they not make, they ſhould loſe a maine and principall ground for this their opinion and practiſe, and therefore this faling them all failes them: I know they are not able to bring any one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for to warrant this expoſition. They have no viſion for it, therefore they are naked, It is built upon the looſe Sand of vain opinion, and not upon the Scriptures, therefore it falls to the ground. All the warrant they have for this expoſition is this, that <hi>(in)</hi> doth often ſignifie <hi>(at)</hi> or <hi>(to)</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this is nothing, except they can bring any Scripture for the whole phraſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Name doth ſignifie (at the mention of the Name) which they cannot doe: For my part, I refuſe not to take the Prepoſition <hi>(or)</hi> as they would have it taken, and ſo it ſhall make for me, and not for them: Let <hi>(in)</hi> be as much, as <hi>(to)</hi> or <hi>(at)</hi> and ſo, for as much as <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed before, that Name of God or Chriſt, doth denote the Power and glory of Chriſt, either expreſſely or implicitely, I take it, this phraſe <hi>In the Name of Ieſus,</hi> may be indifferently referred either to the Power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt expreſſely, ſo the ſence will be this: Every knee or Power ſhall bow at, or to the Power and Glory of Chriſt, or rather to the perſon of Chriſt, implicitely enfolding his Power and Dominion; and then the ſenſe will be this; Every knee ſhall bow at, or to Chriſt. And thus it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to this phraſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.4. <hi>Thee will I bleſſe while I live, I will lift up my hands in thy Name,</hi> that is, I will lift up mine hands to thee, or <hi>I</hi> will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and adore thee, and agrees fitly alſo with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.23. which is applyed to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me.</hi> So that according to the meaning of the Prepoſition <hi>(in)</hi> in their owne ſenſe, the whole phraſe being expounded according to the Analogie of Faith, makes againſt them, and not at all for them.</p>

                        <p>Places are frequent in the Bible to maintaine this: The third Commandement admits it: For there we are injoyned not to mention <hi>Iehovah</hi> in vaine, if Expoſitors may be credited. The

                        <p>You ſay our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, being in the forme of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> layd downe his Name and dignity; and received a Name beneath all Names.</p>
                        <p>I challenge you in theſe words: For though it be true that hee vailed his glory, yet he layd not downe his Name: What he ever was, he remained ſtill the Son of God. Nor did he receive a Name beneath all Names, though he and it were by ſinners handled beneath all degrees of baſeneſſe.</p>

Nay, Power and glory are the eſſentiall vertues of his Perſon, but the Name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, or illuſtrated his, muſt denote who, and what the Perſon is.</p>
                        <p>It followes, that all creatures ſhould ſubject themſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or unwillingly with all their abilities, to Ieſus Chriſt thus gloryfied, and expreſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt is Lord in the glory of God the Father.</p>

                        <p>There is firſt a manifeſting of what he had, no giving of that he had not. Secondly his Name is of Power and glory: Power and glory is not his Name.

                        <p>But to underſtand Name for a proper Name, it is not, you ſay, manifeſted what it is, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>No? Read the Text, and in the tenth Verſe it is the Name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Nor is it abſurd to hold, that God gave his Sonne that Name at his Exaltation, when he received it at his Circumciſion: For, the giving of the Name is the manifeſting and declaring of the Name, as before; and you have ſo expounded it in this Section.</p>

                        <p>The defacing of the Image is the diſgracing of the Prince: and the mocking of the Chriſtian is the ſcorning of Chriſt. <hi>Irriſor non poenitens!

                        <p>Now I may tell you that we make not the Name a cypher. For in the Name we behold the circle of perfection, in it a Unit, in that Unit three angules, and in the middle two natures, and of theſe but one Perſon, <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>

                        <p>Nor yet a meere Watch-word. Indeed the naming gives notice that it is our time, but the Name carries us in our adoration unto

                        <p>Another you have, and this is it: If the Biſhops reaſon be good, then Chriſt ſhall ſend out his Name at that Day to be bowed at, and not come himſelfe in perſon; or if he come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he muſt leave his Name behind him.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>But you ſay, that the diſtinct Names of each Perſon doe not perſonally denote the other Perſons.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:121081:31"/>
                        <p>Doe they not ſo? Where is your Logick? Where your Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks? Have you forgot, that what a Father, as a Father is, he onely is in reſpect of his Sonne? So a Sonne, as a Sonne, is that he is in reſpect of his Father. The Father therfore cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without the Sonne, nor the Sonne without the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt without them both; nor any one without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: becauſe what every one is, is in relation to one another. Yet one is not another; that is, the Father is not the Sonne, nor the Sonne the Holy Ghoſt. Naming then the Father, I confeſſe a diſtinction of Perſons, but apprehend not the one without the other.</p>
                        <p>And here I tell you, that you, ſaying you doe beleeve in God the Father, and not ſaying you doe beleeve in God the Son, muſt inſinuate the Sonne, or elſe you are a <hi>Tritheite.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your inference next that we honouring every Perſon alike, at the Name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> confound the Perſons, ſhewes that you never read, or would not heed the Orthodoxe rule of aſcending the glorious Trinity by his Sonne. <hi>Who ever ſaw, or ever ſhall ſee the Father, ſave in the face of the Sonne? Ioh.</hi> 14.7.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. And I pray, what face is next to us ſave his Name? The Jewes in the Name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> adored, and by the ſame gracious diſpenſation doe we at the Name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> honour God.</p>
                        <p>Nor doth this make the Perſon of the Father in the Perſon of the Sonne, as you boldly argue, but declares that God, who is the bleſſed Trinity, will, and no way elſe, be worſhipped accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good pleaſure in, and through <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt. Nor doth this <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>In that you ſay every Perſon is in one divine eſſence, you ſeeme to be a <hi>Triformian.</hi> For if every Perſon were in one eſſence, there would be, <hi>ter una,</hi> thrice one eſſence: yet this is true that the whole eſſence is in every Perſon. You ſhould therefore have ſaid, every Perſon is in unity of eſſence.</p>
                        <p>Nor doth it therefore follow, that the Name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> being proper to the Second Perſon, and not the Name of the firſt, or third, can denominate but the Second onely. For the Name is not proper to the Second Perſon, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>You contend, that this toleration and this practiſe doe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our opinion of bowing at the Name: and becauſe you doe contend you could queſtion the diſtinction of Divine and Civill worſhip.

                        <p>You ſay, that diſtinction cannot be admitted here: for then how ſhall the advancement of the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> above other Names appeare?</p>
                        <p>Very good: you will give no honour to the King, that the honour of God may the more appeare. Here is <hi>Manicheiſme,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> with a witneſſe. If ſuch Doctrine be preached, be printed, no marvell that the contention is ſo hot for paritie. Have you forgot the ſimilitude our Saviour taught betweene the

I will remember you, it conſiſts in qualitie, both ſincere; in analogie, both from love; and in puniſhment, the violation of both hath the guilt of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation.

                        <p>The Divine worſhip goes not to man; our bowing to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, or at the Name of the King, &amp;c. hath reference to the Ordinance of God. There is no inconſiſtence then betweene the bowing at the Name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and bowing at the Name of <hi>Charles:</hi> for that ſhewes the immediate honour of God, and this other his mediate.</p>
                        <p>At your <hi>againe,</hi> you get as little: For all the Names of God being Divine, ought to be religiouſly handled; and if any man bow at the Name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> unto God, if not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> Ile not forbid him.

Nor doth this imply any contradiction, becauſe <hi>Iehovah</hi> is the Name of God; yet he that bowes at <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and mindes not <hi>Ieſus,</hi> is a <hi>Iew.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And though every Divine Name be alike Divine, yet all Divine Names are not ſet forth alike to us, wherein wee ſhould worſhip God. <hi>Iehovah,</hi> of all, was moſt to the <hi>Iewes, Ieſus</hi> is to us. And though we may, and ſometimes doe, put off a Hat at the Name of, or bow the knee to a Superiour, yet we part not with any Divine worſhip, as this <hi>Jeſu</hi>-prophaner falſely chargeth us. We onely ſignifie our love and high eſteeme of him, as Gods Vice-gerent. Bare Names are not capable of any honour, nor doe we give them any. <hi>Charles</hi> is our Supreme Head, next under <hi>Christ;</hi> and therefore King <hi>Charles</hi> hath, or ſhould have the higheſt reſpect of us on Earth.

                        <p>Secondly, God hath commanded bowing unto Names, if you can underſtand the Things under the Names, and without Names I know you underſtand nothing. Of this you have exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the old and new Teſtament very frequent. But you will ſay, that is to the Name and Thing as the object, not at the Name to the object.

                        <p>I have no more to ſay unto you here, but that as your <hi>Section</hi> began untowardly, ſo it goes out vilely.

                           <p n="2">2. The reaſon will be more evident (if it were lawfull to reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book,) for bowing at the Names, <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>King, &amp;c.</hi> than the Name <hi>Ieſus;</hi> for thus I reaſon:</p>
                           <p>Looke what Names <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the time of his humiliation layd downe, and at the mention of which received diſdaine and reproach, it is meet, that in the time of his exaltation he ſhould receive honour at the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe <hi>Names,</hi> rather than at the mention of that Name, which he layd not downe, and at the mention of which, he received no diſdaine and reproach.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the time of his humiliation, layd not downe his Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> but he layd downe his Glorious <hi>Names,</hi> as <hi>Lord, God, Christ, King,</hi> and at the mention of theſe he ſuffered diſdaine and reproach, not at the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Therefore it is meet, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> now in the time of his exaltation ſhould be honoured at the mention of his Glorious Names, <hi>Lord, God, Chriſt, King &amp;c.</hi> rather than at the mention of the Name <hi>Ieſus.</hi> So we ſee plainly, that if there were a reaſon in the Conſequent, it makes not ſo much for the Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as for the Names above-ſpoken. If it be replyed, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> having been humbled in his Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> it is therefore neceſſary, that he ſhould receive honour in that <hi>Name,</hi> being exalted. I anſwer, if their meaning be this, that becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was called by the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> being humbled, therefore he ought to be bowed to at the ſound of that <hi>Name</hi> being exalted, it is a ſenſeleſſe reaſon without any proofe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, or ground, therefore let them prove it, or ceaſe ever to mention it. If this were neceſſary, why were not thoſe Worthies <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> Types of <hi>Chriſts humiliation,</hi> as of <hi>his exaltation,</hi> by a ſpeciall appoyntment of <hi>God</hi> bowed to, when they were advanced, at their diſtinct Names of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> being ſo called when they were humbled? In another ſenſe it is true in <hi>Chriſt</hi> (though it be not an ever-binding rule) for he ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes honoured by the <hi>Church</hi> in that Name, which ſhall not bee layd downe.</p>

                        <p>But an other anſwer you muſt have, and this is it.</p>
                        <p>You were told before that Chriſt layd downe no Name: Hee kept all that ever he was, though in a peculiar manner he by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation veiled his Glory. A Name he received, and that is his perſonall Name <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That doth reach him fully, Chriſt doth not: For God could not be annoynted. Nor is God his full Name; for he is man alſo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ieſus</hi> doth both; His full Name therefore is his proper Name.</p>
                        <p>What occaſion then ſoever was taken at his other Attributes, which moved the Jewes, their hatred came ſtill to <hi>Ieſus.</hi> They diſdained that he a Carpenter, Sonne ſhould be called Lord, or God, or Chriſt, or King.

                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Now I'le tell you what here appeares, even a compoſition of Syllogiſmes.</p>
                        <p>In the Major of two, is, <hi>Confuſio terminorum,</hi> and, <hi>falſum ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum</hi> too.</p>
                        <p>You ſuppoſe that Chriſt layd down his Names, Lord, God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:121081:54"/> Which, if you meane, as the Soule was layd downe from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is Arrianiſme. But if you will mollifie, layd downe, by veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concealing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I wiſh it might by all be underſtood, then the queſtion is changed, not onely from Name to Names, but from the Name ſcorned, to the Name veiled. The queſtion is not of Names moſt concealed, but of the Name ſcorned moſt.</p>
                        <p>There is alſo falſe compoſition <hi>a bene conjunctis ad male diviſas.</hi> For, what meane you by, at the mentioning of theſe, Lord, God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that when he was called Lord, or God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hee ſuffered diſdaine? And ſo it is true in the conjunction, not in the diviſion. True, <hi>in compoſito,</hi> he was Scorned, when called Lord, God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that therefore the Name Lord, or God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was Scorned <hi>in ſimplici termino</hi> is falſe.</p>
                        <p>And thus your owne argument is ſtrong againſt your ſelfe. When <hi>Ieſus</hi> was called Lord, or Sonne of God, or Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Jewes hated the very Name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Not deriding the Name Lord, or Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they could not endure either <hi>in compoſito;</hi> that is, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhould be Lord, or God, or Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ieſus,</hi> not Lord, nor God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ſtill the Name of contempt.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon that you ſubjoyne, for bowing at the Name, they owne it, that will, I doe not. The reaſon that I give, is, becauſe God hath highly exalted it by the Union and for our Salvation. And one reaſon, that it is higheſt exalted, is becauſe it was loweſt humbled. See my <hi>Antiteich Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
                        <p>Your inference from the Type is not againſt this. Yet you may know, that when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were advanced, they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in, at, and under the Name of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I may tell you that if, in the foot of this <hi>Section,</hi> by Church you meane the Triumphant alſo, you contradict your ſelf, where you ſaid that <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhould not be mentioned hereafter <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</p>

                        <p>To your demand I have often made anſwer, that we take not the Name without the ſenſe; nor doe we make compariſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Perſons; nor hold we that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is one, <hi>Iehovah</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>Lord</hi> another. We doe diſtinguiſh the Eſſentiall Name, and the Relations, and not divide the eſſence, nor ſeparate the Perſons. And diſtinguiſhing betweene Names and Titles of the ſame Perſon make not Chriſt two.</p>
                        <p>If we did, as you doe here inſinuate, and, in your third ranke of abſurdities at the tenth, doe openly charge the Church, wee ſhould by your firſt reaſon be <hi>Neſtorians;</hi> by your ſecond <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Socinians,</hi> as impious as your ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>To your ſecond anſwer I reply, that you are very abſurd to thinke we attribute temporall ſalvation to <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. But this we affirme, that God was in the Old Teſtament,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:121081:56"/> knowne by the Name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but in the New more fully by the Name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Yet not as if <hi>Iehovah</hi> were <hi>aliud,</hi> and <hi>aliud Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> one thing and another, but the ſame eſſentially. For the one-moſt God is the three Perſons; and ſo Salvation is the work of the whole Trinitie.</p>
                        <p>The places you cite are plaine for us, the ſame, <hi>Iehovah Elohim,</hi> Lord God, which is the Father and the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt, is our Saviour, our Redeemer.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe hitherto, unleſſe you would be conceived a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theite, you have writ nothing to any purpoſe, Ile tell you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if you will promiſe me to remember it, to great purpoſe. This is it. Though our Redemption be a worke of the whole Trinitie, yet by the eternall Counſell, it was terminated onely in the Perſon of the Sonne of God. He therefore is ſet forth, that in and by him the other Perſons with him may have the glory.</p>

                        <p>And this Ile prove firſt, by your owne Firſt. For God gave him this, and that after his Humiliation; therefore it was not a Name naturally his, as a Perſon of the Trinitie. That's yours.</p>

                           <p>The Conſequent is very plaine; for the <hi>Glory of God</hi> is the <hi>end</hi> of all his workes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.4.

                        <p>Nay, if we ſo <hi>bow,</hi> the Devils ſervice will be more ſincere then ours: O Blaſphemie againſt God and his Church! Unto what Times hath God reſerved us?

                        <p>But what's the reaſon of ſuch baſe thoughts? This is it. The Devils, ſay you, muſt <hi>bow</hi> to him <hi>gratis,</hi> and as he is their Lord.

                        <p>The Queſtion Doctor <hi>Page</hi> hath there in hand, is, whether of theſe two Names, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> doe leade us moſt of all to his Suffering and Sorrowes? He affirmes the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> doth, you denie it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Your firſt Reaſon is, that the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in the plaine ſignification of it, doth not directly ſignifie <hi>dying.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Doctor <hi>Page</hi> choakes your argument thus: <q>He was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe <hi>he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes, Mat.</hi> 1.21. How is this done? Goe to another Text, and that will tell you, that <hi>without ſhedding of bloud there is no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. You ſee then, that neere of Kin is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſhedding of bloud; and therefore you may perceive, that this Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> leades us directly to his bitter Death and Paſſion. I can no ſooner ſay <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but preſently I thinke of <hi>dying.</hi> And that you may know how neere <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and <hi>dying, ſaving</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> are, the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> will tell you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.20. <hi>He that is our God, is the

                        <p>I may tell you, that the Heathen, in their ſacrificing men, had an inſtinct hereof: For they beleeved, <hi>pro vita hominis niſi vita ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis reddatur,</hi>

                        <p>Salvation by <hi>dying,</hi> was never ſo ſtrange in the World as you dreame, that it might be ſuppoſed onely by very few. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples indeed had, till the Reſurrection carnall thoughts of Chriſts Kingdome; but after they received the Holy-Ghoſt, they preached nothing more then <hi>Ieſus</hi> crucified.</p>
                        <p>What you ſay of the Name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is full againſt your ſelfe. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> denoting a <hi>King,</hi> ſignifies one that is readie to Rule; denoting a <hi>Priest,</hi> one about to offer Sacrifice; and denoting a <hi>Prophet,</hi> one that can fore-tell things to come. All theſe are active and honourable Names, ſaith the Learned Doctor; in all theſe I can perceive no ſigne of Death.</p>
                        <p>You ſay well, and that is all you can ſay; a <hi>Prieſts</hi> Office was to ſhed bloud, but not his Office to ſhed his owne bloud. 'Twas <hi>Chriſts</hi> as <hi>Ieſus,</hi> not as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to lay downe his life for ſinners.</p>
                        <p>To your <hi>Sorites,</hi> that concludes nothing, I anſwer; God can doe any thing which contradicts not his Will and Being. No

                           <p>Secondly, The Conſequent is to be denyed, for if the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhould above all other <hi>Names</hi> ſignifie Chriſts <hi>death,</hi> it will not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the <hi>principall Name</hi> to be bowed to.

                        <p n="1">1. The Exaltation is according to the Humiliation. If it were loweſt, and there be a Name to be exalted, that will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted higheſt.

                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond is againſt the order of the Text. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus, Phil.</hi> 2.6. He is our example; if wee looke unto him for Glory, wee muſt firſt looke on him as the example of Humilitie: For by Humilitie, and no other way elſe, goe wee into Glory.

The Queſtion is not, whether we muſt <hi>bow</hi> at it, becauſe it remembers us of <hi>dying;</hi> but whether it were not the moſt humble Name; and fitteſt to be exalted higheſt? We doe not <hi>bow</hi> at it, becauſe it puts us in minde of <hi>dying,</hi> but becauſe it was the Name ſo humbled, and is now exalted <hi>above every Name.</hi> This is one Reaſon, but the Command is Chiefe; and therefore we doe it onely when, and as it is commanded.</p>

                        <p>But you anſwer, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſignifies the Office of a Saviour, as well as Chriſt, as you have proved.</p>
                        <p>Have you? I know not where: But if you have, you have by ſo doing, caſt your ſelfe. Remember you, that throughout your whole Booke, <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a proper Name, and here you ſay it is a Name of Office: if then it be both, it is more excellent then that which is the Name of Office onely.</p>
                        <p>You reply that the Name Chriſt doth every where denote the Perſon.</p>
                        <p>'Tis confeſſed before, that it doth imply the Perſon; but not that it is the proper perſonall Name. This is not proved by you, nor ever will be.</p>
                        <p>That there is no Scripture for this practiſe, hath beene urged, and anſwered often.</p>
                        <p>You yet reply, that Chriſt brings us to God, therefore wee muſt pray the Father in the Name of Chriſt, but Scripture doth not ſay, that therefore we muſt bow at the Name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
